<H1>Kafka Message Producer-Consumer</H1>

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Kafka-based messaging system. It includes:

- **Producer**: Sends messages (plain text or JSON objects) to a Kafka topic.
- **Consumer**: Listens to the Kafka topic and processes (displays) the messages.

## Features

- Send plain text or JSON messages to a Kafka topic.
- Real-time consumption and display of messages from the topic.
- Easy-to-extend architecture for more complex processing.

## Prerequisites

1. **Apache Kafka**: Ensure Kafka is installed and running locally or on a server.
2. **Java**: JDK 17 or later.
3. **Maven/Gradle**: For managing project dependencies.
